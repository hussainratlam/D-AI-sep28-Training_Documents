Containerization using Docker :::	

	--> Containerization :::
	
			- It is a process of packaging the Application along with it's dependencies.
			- Mainly used to deploy Micro-Service Based Applications
	
	
	Virtual Machines ::
	
		- VMs are considered as Hardware Level Virtualization.
		- VMs are created using Hypervisor
		- VMs are used to run the Operating System.
		- VM will continue to run even if there is no Active Application/Task
		- VMs Consume more CPU/Memory, and Consume more time to start-up 
	
	Containers ::
	
		- Containers are considered as OS Level Virtualization.
		- Containers are created using Container Engine 
		- Containers are used to run the Application/Task. Not Operating System 
		- If the Application/Task completed or if there is no Application/Task to execute, the Containers will immediately got to exit state.
		- Containers will Start the Application/Task faster when compared to VMs 
		- Containers Consume less CPU/Memory, and Consume more time to start-up	
		
		- Using Containers we can reduce the no. of VMs.

	Use Cases ::
	
		Infra-Structure Perspective :
		
			- Jenkins Master-Slave Architecture 
			
				- Jenkins_Master (VM) 			# Is to create the CICD Pipeline Projects and schedule the project to run the slave nodes.
					Jenkins_SlaveNode1(VM)		# Build Java Applications
					Jenkins_SlaveNode2(VM)		# Build Python Applications
					Jenkins_SlaveNode3(VM)		# Build .Net Applications
					Jenkins_SlaveNode4(VM)		# Build Angular/NodeJS Applications
					Jenkins_SlaveNode5(VM)		# Build Ruby Applications
					
				- Jenkins_Master (VM)
					Jenkins_SlaveNode1(VM)
						- Container Engine 
							C1 					# Build Java Applications
							C2                  # Build Python Applications
							C3                  # Build .Net Applications
							C4                  # Build Angular/NodeJS Applications
							C5                  # Build Ruby Applications
						
				Using Containers we can reduce the no. of VMs.
				
				
		
		Development/Deployment Perspective :


	--> Containerization :::
	
			- It is a process of packaging the Application along with it's dependencies.

			Developer:
			
				- Create Source Code 
				- Build - Create Artifacts --> mywebapp.war_v1.0 (Application Artifact)
					- Unit Testing --> 
						Tomcat WAS 	--> jdk17,tomcat8.5 to run mywebapp.war_v1.0 
						
						Package - (mywebapp.war_v1.0,jdk17,tomcat8.5)	--> mywebapp_Img:v1.0 (Application Image)
						
						Deploy the Application Image to Target Environment through Container Registries.
					
				- Deploy to Target Environment(QA)
				
				- QA Environment - mywebapp.war_v1.0 			# mywebapp_Img:v1.0(mywebapp.war_v1.0,jdk17,tomcat8.5)
						C1 - mywebapp_Img
					
				
				- UAT Environment - mywebapp.war_v1.0			# mywebapp_Img:v1.0(mywebapp.war_v1.0,jdk17,tomcat8.5)
						C1 - mywebapp_Img
							
				- PROD Environment - mywebapp.war_v1.0			# mywebapp_Img:v1.0(mywebapp.war_v1.0,jdk17,tomcat8.5)
						C1 - mywebapp_Img
		
		

	
	Terminologies ::
		
		- Container Engine : 		# Used to Create and Manage Container Images and Containers
									# Docker Container Engine 
			
		
		- Container Image :	 		# Is a static file that defines the properties and dependencies of the Application	
									# Container Images are Non-Executable 
									# It Composed of various layers
									# These layers are create using Dockerfile Instructions
		
		- Container :		 		# Containers are the executable units of Container Image.
		
		- Container Registry : 		# It used to Manage/Version Control the Container Images.
									# DockerHub 
		
		- Container Repositories :	# These are the sub-set of Container Registry.
		
		
	
	Working with Containerization ::::
	
	
		- Install Container Engine.
			- Docker.
			
			$ apt install docker.io 	# Install in a AWS EC2 Instance. Jenkins_SlaveNode1(VM)
			
		- Docker CLI Commands.
		
		docker --version 
		
		docker images 			# To get the list container images present in the local machine 

		docker ps 				# To get the list of Active Containers 
		
		docker ps -a 			# To get the list of all Active Containers as well the containers in exit state. 
		
		Container Registry		# DockerHub - Create an Account.
										https://hub.docker.com/
										
										
		docker pull 			# To Download the Container Image from Container Registry to Local Machine.
		
			Eg.: docker pull <image_name>:<tag>
			
					docker pull centos 
					
		
		docker run <Image_Name>	# To create a Container		
		
			Three Mode of Container Execution ::
		
				- Foreground/Attached Mode 			# Default
				
					- docker run centos 
				
				- Background/Detached Mode 
				
					- docker run -d centos 
					
				- Interactive Mode 
				
					- docker run -it centos bash
		
	
		docker start <container_id>		# To Start a Container	

		docker exec -it <container_id> bash # To Login to the running Container.
		
		docker stop <container_id>		# To Stop a Container	
		
		docker rm <Container_id>		# To Remove Container 
		
		docker rmi <Image_id>			# To Remove Container Image  
		
		docker rmi -f <Image_id>		# To Remove Container Image forcefully  
		
		
		Container Port Mapping / Binding :::
		
		
			docker run -it -p 8089:8080 tomcat:8.0 
			
			Port Mapping :
			
				-p <host_port>:<container_port>
				
				
			VM1
				Tomcat C1	- 8088
				Tomcat C2   - 8089
				
		
		docker logs <contianer_id>		# To get the container logs
		
			Eg.: docker logs 5aaafa0c36bb
